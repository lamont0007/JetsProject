# JetsProject

# Description
This project was use to expand our way of thinking and how we approach code.  This project gave me the opportunity to incorporate interfaces, reading text files, implementations, and extending classes and abstract classes.

# What Did You Learn
With this project, I learned the importance of calling a method properly.  Giving methods the proper arguments and parameters.
# Technologies
I use eclipse to compile my Java code.  I used Google to see if I could get a better explanation of where to put my methods.  I use the class recordings to understand the interfaces better. And I use TA hours to assist in understanding the "why" that is essential to understanding the logic behind the methods.
